    			<h4 class="pb-3">Athena Consumer Products Pvt. Ltd. was founded in 2019. The six shareholders/co-founders and promoters of ACPPL are all well known, experienced and highly respected professionals in the FMCG and Retail industry.</h4>
    			<p>What sets ACPPL apart is the hands on and in-depth experience of its shareholders in creating, building and launching successful businesses, time and time again. Given their individual professional journeys and their knowledge of the global and Indian consumer and trends, the shareholders came together to build a consumer-facing personal care brand with a unique proposition. The proposition entails a one-of-a-kind integration of high quality and highly effective actives made from botanical extracts and high performing natural ingredient extracts that combine seamlessly in creating personal care beauty products that are guaranteed for effectiveness. An important and key aspect of all products that are made by ACCPL is that they are subjected to the safest quality standards, are free from sulphates, parabens, parrafins, silicon and are also non-comedogenic.</p>
    			<p>In the words of the Co-Founders “It has taken us over 2 years of research to get the formulations and products right. We have researched the market intensively and found a unique need gap. Consumers are adopting science-based products, but are also demanding natural and safe ingredients. Our products blend the two spectrums beautifully. We believe in ‘Nature’s bounty & Modern Science’, and this combination was the inspiration behind Activ Beauté - Where Science Meets Nature. The secret powering our effective products is a range of potent ‘actives’ derived from biological sources and proven to work wonders on skin in the most gentle and  safe ways. Along with the powerful actives, our products have pure extracts from natural ingredients like pomegranate, tulsi, saffron, honey, almond milk, lemon, tea tree, watermelon, turmeric, avocado and Vitamin E amongst others.”</p>
